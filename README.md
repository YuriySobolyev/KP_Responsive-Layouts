One of the most frequently cited excuses for adopting a desktop-first approach is that it aligns with the design provided. Nevertheless, as we've explored the possibilities of mobile-first development, we can still effectively handle this situation. Let's put this knowledge into action!

With a mobile-first mindset, we'll be well-equipped to create a responsive and visually appealing user experience across various devices.
